			<p>This is our terms of service, an agreement between you and Doge Utilities. In order to use our services, you must be older than 13 years old, and be legally permitted to use Discord. By inviting and using Doge Utilities, you allow us to collect data about you (and the server/guild you're use the bot in) as stated in the Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p>We have the right to restrict you from using our bot by disallowing you to use it. If you are blacklisted/restricted from using the bot, you will not longer be able to use the bot's commands, contact the support team, and request deletion of your data or your server's data. More rules are stated below.</p>
			<p>Be sure not to break Discord's Terms of Service, use macros or autoclickers to automatically interact with the bot, advertise the bot as yours, and DDoS the website. Not following these rules will lead you to being blacklisted and banned on the support server (if severe).</p>
