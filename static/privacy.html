			<p>Data is automatically collected. Data is required in our case, since the bot requires data in order to work properly. This privacy policy will explain why we collect your data and what we use your data for. All of the data that we collect are legal, and will not include anything outside of Discord. Your data will be kept for as long as necessary for the purposes that are stated below.</p>
			<p>Doge Utilities has permission from Discord to collect information about the messages you send and the members in any server that the bot is in. Intents like these are only given to trusted bots. More details will be described below.
			<p>- The Message Intent (or Message Content Intent) is a feature that allows bots to read the content in the messages you send. This intent is required for auto-moderation features, such as chat filters. There are 4 filters in Doge Utilities that use this intent: links, insults, mention, and newline. If a Discord server that you're in are using these features provided by Doge Utilities, please be informed that your messages will be logged (only if they trigger the filters). Note: We do not store your messages outside of Discord. If you trigger a filter (for example send a link when the link filter is enabled), the message that you sent will be forwarded to the server's log channel.</p>
			<p>- Doge Utilities also has the Server Members Intent, which allows bots to access the list of members within a Discord server. We require this intent because of welcome/leave messages, simple utility commands (such as the nickname command), and a few more that are listed in the Commands page.</p>
